# Project 2 for CUNY MSDS


I selected 3 different data sets from other students in DATA 607:



## From Yuen Chun Wong:

Analysis Idea:

-Collision time and location frequencies

-Location & cause of the collision

-cause of the collision & vehicle type

-Time & vehicle type (e.g. moterist is more likely driving on the road in summer than winter)

## From Chunhui Zhu 
Hospital Compare Website has collected data by comparing the quality of care at over 4000 midiacare-certified hospital across the country.


Data includes the following factors: Patient Safely indicator, 30-day rates of readmission, and 30-day death(mortality) rates.

Data issue: 

     1.the number of cases/patients is too few to report

     2.Data submitted were based on a sample of cases/patients.

     3.Results are based on a shorter time period than required.

     4.Data suppressed by CMS for one  or more quarters.

     5.Results are not available for this reporting period

The above are the top 5 reasons making inaccurate data.

## From Christina Kasman:

The Airbnb data set has all listings of all rentals for different countries. 
The data set can be analyzed in several different ways, for example to compare ratings and prices for different neighborhoods. 
It is interesting to look at how different neighborhoods differ and also relate the ratings back to the comments.
