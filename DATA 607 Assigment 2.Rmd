```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
if(!require(RPostgreSQL)){
    install.packages("RPostgreSQL")
    library(RPostgreSQL)
}
```

Password:
I created a pasword outside of the r markdown in order to keep it secret. If I was not publishing this script I include it in place of the "****"
```{r}
#pw <- {
 # "**********"
#}
```

Loading postgres
```{r}
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "Mydb",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "postgres", password = pw)
rm(pw)
```
Getting the data:
```{r}
df <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM movie_table")
kable(head(df,20))
```
